/** @mainpage Arduino-GPIO

The Arduino GPIO library has been developed to allow high performance
digital pin access. Most access functions are compiled to a single
instruction and execute in 1-2 clock cycles. The library functions are
more than 10 times faster than the Arduino digital pin functions. In
some cases as much as 100 times faster.

Additional support classes are available for Debounced Digital
(Button) and Analog Pin (Keypad), Shift Register Parallel Input and
Output (SRPI, SRPO and SRPIO), and Serial (Software::Serial). These
also demonstrate how the GPIO template class may be used to construct
additional classes and libraries.

This library supports boards based on SAM3X8E, ATmega168, ATmega328P,
ATmega32U4, ATmega1280, ATmega2560, ATtinyX4 and ATtinyX5.
