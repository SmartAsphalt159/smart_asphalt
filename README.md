This repository contains code for Smart Asphalt, a senior design project aimed at measuring control delay from the propogation of information. We will be using Jetson Nanos to drive a platoon of vehicles. The first car will be driven via a radio transmitter and the subsequent cars will aim to mimick the actions of the car in front of them. The cars will exchange braking, steering, and speed via a V2V mesh network. The control system will aim to fuse local sensor data with this network data to allow a vehicle to mimick a vehicle in front of it. We will also be implenting a 2D lidar sensor and corresponding algorithm to help analyze the steering data.
